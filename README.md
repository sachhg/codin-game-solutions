# ðŸ§  CodinGame Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various programming challenges from [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/), an online platform for competitive programming and game-based coding challenges.

I use these problems to sharpen my skills in **C++**, **Python**, and other languages (but mostly C++), while exploring creative problem-solving, game AI, and algorithm design.

Each folder corresponds to the difficulty or category of the problem. Solutions include inline comments and are written with clarity and efficiency in mind.
